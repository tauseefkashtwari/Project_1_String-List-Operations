# Project 1 - String and List Operations
This project is part of coursework for CMPT 300: Operating Systems (SPRING 2018) taken at Simon Fraser University (SFU). This project involved filling methods for operations on lists (Linked-List implementation) and basic string operations (comparing two strings, creating a duplicate of a string, and calculating string length, which is a basic operation).
